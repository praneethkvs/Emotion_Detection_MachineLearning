# Emotion_Detection_MachineLearning
Emotion Detection Model using Deep Learning Techniques

•	Detecting and Classifying emotions from human speech samples.  
•	Used Librosa package in python to load and pre-process audio data, performed feature engineering.  
•	Explored different Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network models using ML libraries Keras and TensorFlow.  
•	Built a final model using a modified VGG-16 network Architecture with an accuracy of 65% in predicting 8 different emotions as compared     to a human accuracy of 60%.
